      "featureTitle": "Fix the authenticated actor construction so that `createActor` is never called with both an `agent` parameter and `agentOptions` simultaneously. When an authenticated Internet Identity is present, construct a single `HttpAgent` from that identity and pass only the `agent` parameter. When unauthenticated, pass only `agentOptions` with the anonymous configuration. This ensures the correct non-anonymous principal is forwarded to all backend calls including admin endpoints, resolving the 'Actor not available' error in `ProductForm`.",
