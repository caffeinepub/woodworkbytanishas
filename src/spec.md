# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix admin authentication to allow proper access to the admin panel and integrate WhatsApp for customization requests.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix admin panel authentication so Internet Identity users are recognized as admins and can access the Add Product interface without privilege errors
- Configure customization form to send request details directly to WhatsApp number +91 9828288383 with pre-filled message including customer name, contact details, product specifications, wood type, dimensions, and additional notes

**User-visible outcome:** Authenticated admins can successfully add products through the admin panel, and customers interested in customized products can submit their requirements directly via WhatsApp with all form details pre-populated.
